# Intuitive Robotic Plastering

Human-machine collaboration for robotic on-site fabrication

## Introduction

This is a 11-week project of the MAS ETH in Architecture and Digital Fabrication explores the potential of novel digital fabrication processes to implement a full-scale construction project at Rümlang, Zürich. The topic combines Gramazio Kohler Research projects, Robotic Plaster Spraying and Human-Machine Collaboration, to propose new design and fabrication methodologies under the name of Intuitive Robotic Plastering.

On one hand the concept of Human-Machine Collaboration(Intuitive Design) is to think how human gestures are used as a design tool expressing very singular and sensible design process. On the other hand, Robotic Plaster Spraying allows to think through a different paradigm where and how plaster is applied by iteration of fine and subtle layers on the wall.
