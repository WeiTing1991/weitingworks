## Introduction 
Digital Casting System (DCS) is a Innosuisse project as well as a new novel approach for Smart Dynamic Casting(SDC). This package works to transition automated digital casting systems from the laboratory to the industry scale by overcoming the challenges addressed by inline mixing. DCS involves identifying optimal values for comprehensive system parameters, including processing and material characteristics, while carefully considering specific system requirements.

This package has three parts, which contain PLC controller for control components, DCS library for middleware, robotic control, and data handling; lastly, DCS application uses for real-time data recording and production simulation.
