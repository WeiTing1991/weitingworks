## Description
Nowadays, we use several different 3D modeling software in architectural design process. At our five-day workshop, we mainly focus on establishing a digital design workflow and integrating different software. 

The workshop consists of four parts: 1.basic geometry construction; 2.form-finding through physical simulation; 3.utilizing oscillating tangential cutting machine to produce physical model; 4.data visualization and rendering. The workshop anticipated to stimulate new model for digital design.

## Methodology
The design process includes four step: construct primitive points, mesh structure, physical stimulate engine to generate the geometry and design the form-finding process, and generate the pattern based on reaction diffusion algorithms.
