FORM FINDING GEOMETRY WORKSHOP

Workshop

Year : 2018
Place : Taiwan

Lecturer : Wei-Ting Chen, Yu Chen, Ping-Hsun Tsai
Teaching Assistant : Ming-Yang Wang, Po-Yen Chen


Description
Nowadays, we use several different 3D modeling software in architectural design process. At our five-day workshop,
we mainly focus on establishing a digital design workflow and integrating different software.
The workshop consists of four parts:
1.basic geometry construction; 2.form-finding through physical simulation; 3.utilizing oscillating tangential cutting machine to produce
physical model; 4. data visualization and rendering.
The workshop anticipated to stimulate new model for digital design.
