Abstract
This is a research_based thesis with morphogenesis structure with nonplanar robotic 3D printing.
The process of matter is to gather independently or have an agent system, and it would create new
methods with autonomous assemblies and collective construction through new machines and materials.
As a bottom-up development, this process attempts to practice extensibility, adaptability, repeatability
and any number of aggregations.


Morphogenesis structure study
In the steps of design, the particle units start with points by complex systems and generative algorithms,
making a large number of discrete individuals grow and contributing to one or more faces of continuous
geometry.It divides into three different categories: “Morphing of the point – Curve”, “Morphing of the curve – Surface”,
and “Morphing of the surface – Space”.


reinterpretd historic gothic church

In the first stage, the goal is to use modern tools to i n terpret the long established Gothic church
through movement of particles to explore the possibility of generative architectural space.
By comparing the traditional and contemporary media of design, The existing method of architectural
design was removed. The collection of multi-scale spatial elements blurs the
boundary between form, structure and decoration, reinterpreting the meaning of Gothic church space; this
meaning is the expression of force in structure and emphasized in the traditional Gothic church.
Also, the generation process of computational dynamic
simulation implies the formation of the Gothic church structure.

virtual reality
This space of the Gothic church based on a computersimulation is combined with the virtual reality system,
called VIVE developed by HTC, creating the simulated space experience through the head-mounted display.

robotic fabrication
The simulated Gothic space is complex and cannot be easily constructed by hand, some of the simulated building elements 
were actually constructed in the real space by the Robotic 3D Printing with nonplanar method.

As well as, I’m also Mr. Chen’s thesis design advisor in the Fall, 2017 and the Spring 2018. 
In his thesis design "Autonomous Tectonic: Meta-Matter", Mr. Chen reinterpreted the generation 
process of the historic Gothic church with contemporary digital design media. Mr. Chen’s work 
includes the following three parts: (1) computer simulation: The particle simulation was
 applied to explore the process for generation, and different agent-based systems and computer 
animation were used to simulate the generation of spaces; (2) virtual reality: computer-simulated 
Gothic church space, and combined with the virtual reality VIVE system developed by HTC after computing
, to entering the virtual space for experiencing through the gargle; (3) real construction: the simulated 
Gothic space is complex and cannot be easily constructed by hand, some of the simulated building elements 
were actually constructed in the real space by the 7-axis KUKA 3D Printing. Mr. Chen’s thesis project won 
several important awards at Taiwan, as well as his thesis work was
